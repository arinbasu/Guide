<h2 data-label="986144" class="ltx_title_subsection">The configuration file for a figure</h2><div>Colaboratory for a hosted python notebook is a great way to get things done in this scheme. My only peeve with colaboratory is that I could not get it to work in directly pushing to github otherwise in terms of building real time collaborative data analysis in python, it should be second to none. Try r-brain.io if you want. Another option is to use mybinder.org. Any environment that allows you some slack to use git along with analytical tools should be fine.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>While we are on this, some technical nitty gritty of setting it up is in order. We will focus on three different documents that can be updated and dynamically change the configuration of this text depending on how the work is being done and where the analyses are being conducted. Authorea allows one to write text and share files, but it does not allow direct analysis of data beyond sharing a jupyter notebook. But once this jupyter notebook is shared and participants are added to the document, and if those participants can also be shared with the github or the git repo where part of the work is maintained, then this document becomes a dynamically updated document with every iteration of analyses and pushing and pullng through git.&nbsp;</div>
