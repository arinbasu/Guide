<h2 data-label="986144" class="ltx_title_subsection">The configuration file for a figure</h2><div>Colaboratory is a great way to get things done. My only peever with colaboratory is the grief it gave me in directly pushing to github otherwise in terms of buidSome technical nitty gritty of setting it up is in order. We will focus on three different documents that can be updated and dynamically change the configuration of this text depending on how the work is being done and where the analyses are being conducted. Authorea allows one to write text and share files, but it does not allow direct analysis of data beyond sharing a jupyter notebook. But once this jupyter notebook is shared and participants are added to the document, and if those participants can also be shared with the github or the git repo where part of the work is maintained, then this document becomes a dynamically updated document with every iteration of analyses and pushing and pullng through git.&nbsp;</div>
