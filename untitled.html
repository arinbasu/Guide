<div></div><h2 data-label="141528" class="ltx_title_subsection">Preamble</h2><div>You can control a web based writing system and presentation system entirely offline and opportunistic availability of going online using a state of the art version control. This is particularly valuable in public health and epidemiology where we need to work as new data becomes available. Also, for conducting a continuously updated meta analysis, this is a valuable approach. My intention here is to put a step by step guide on using Authorea and Jupyter notebooks to do reproducible data science in public health that brings in not just dynamically updating a document but doing so seamlessly and brining in the power of a team to provide necessary insights throughout the document <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Peng_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In brief,&nbsp; the steps are as follows:</div><div></div><div>Step 1: Start with Authorea and set up an article</div><div>Step 2: Link the article to github or a git repo, do a remote add origin to the github to your local hard drive on a folder after installing git locally</div><div>Step 3:&nbsp; Start a jupyter notebook and use the python module (python 2 and python 3). You can use R as well; I'd say if you want to use a notebook and want to use R, use an Rnotebook in Rstudio; the effects will be same for the workflow that I outline here.</div><div>Step 6: Use git to push the ipynb into the Authorea repo; ditto for Rnotebook markdown to push tables, figures, and text generated in the Rnotebook.</div><div></div><div>I have included a demo with this a tutorial on data analysis with jupyter notebook with python 3</div><div></div><div>Keep in mind these general principles:</div><div></div><div><b>Write in markdown and for tables use csv files and for figures use jpg files</b></div><div><b>Store the csv files in subfolders in the figures folder&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Store the jpeg files in subfolders in the figures folder</b></div><div><b>Use the layout.md file to position the various </b></div><div></div><div>In Authorea itself, it does not matter what format you use to write your text. </div><div></div><h2 data-label="410256" class="ltx_title_subsection">Step 1: Start with authorea</h2><div></div><div>The purpose of this paper is to build a dynamically updated paper as new information comes in and new analyses are conducted. We would need some dynamically updated parts and some consistent parts in such a document. We also need to collaborate and share the document, keep everything open so that the source code of the analyses remain in public domain. In any scholarly or information sharing publication, you need four elements:</div><div></div><ul><li>You need to produce tables of information</li><li>You need to provide your readers visualisation of elements</li><li>You need to attribute your arguments or statements with sources (citations)</li><li>For reproducible research you need to provide source codes of your analyses (here we have used python but you can use R or Julia as well). </li></ul><div>Mixing Authorea with dynamically developed graphs and tables is a great way to work. You can do all of these in the Authorea main interface by uploading from your local hard drive but you may also want to work on the web on the fly and here github is your friend. You will next need to do a couple of things:</div><div></div><h2 data-label="949138" class="ltx_title_subsection">Tables, figures, bibliography and layout</h2><div></div><div>For each of your figure and table you will need to create two files: a config.yml file and a caption.html file. The caption file will contain caption and the config.yml file will be different for figures and tables. The table with csv data will contain the ipynb file and the figure will contain the config.yml file and the caption.html file. The caption.html file will only contain the title for the figure or the table. The config.yml file is more involved and will contain the following set of codes:</div><div></div><div></div>
