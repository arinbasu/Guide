<div></div><h2 data-label="141528" class="ltx_title_subsection">Preamble</h2><div>We are living in interesting times in the sense we are drowned in a world of data that are asking for analyses and generation of insights. Evidence based data analysis, particularly for public health is a necessity. This evidence drives much of public policy and debates and generates evidence. The problem though is, often the articles and knowledge that gets generated is rooted in an opaque practice where the readers are not allowed an access to the process that generated the information: at times the methods are sparsely described, or they are behind paywalls, or not explicit enough. </div><div></div><div>Which is why there is a growing movement of reproducible and replicable research designs. What is replicable is not necessarily reproducible. While the methods of data collection and analyses are made explicit, one does not necessarily share the data and the methods used to generate the insights, or the testing of hypotheses. Reproducible research takes the additional steps of sharing the data and the steps taken to conduct the analyses. </div><div></div><div>Yet this is a stepping stone into the larger more complex world where research gets done not by one person but by the group. Research, particularly in the context of public health, is team sport. The theorist brings together the questions, the epidemiologist brings the data and the methods, the analyst takes the data and crunches the numbers. Together everyone writes. There is a need for transparency at every end and we also owe it to ourselves to make it as easy as possible for our readers to get a glimpse into that world and verify for themselves what we have done. </div><div></div><div>Added to this is the </div><div></div><div>You can control a web based writing system and presentation system entirely offline and opportunistic availability of going online using a state of the art version control. This is particularly valuable in public health and epidemiology where we need to work as new data becomes available. Also, for conducting a continuously updated meta analysis, this is a valuable approach. My intention here is to put a step by step guide on using Authorea and Jupyter notebooks to do reproducible data science in public health that brings in not just dynamically updating a document but doing so seamlessly and brining in the power of a team to provide necessary insights throughout the document&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Peng_2011}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In brief,&nbsp; the steps are kind of as follows:</div><div></div><div>Step 1: Start with Authorea and set up an article</div><div>Step 2: Link the article to github or a git repo, do a remote add origin to the github to your local hard drive on a folder after installing git locally</div><div>Step 3:&nbsp; Start a jupyter notebook in the root folder of the git repo and use the python module (python 2 and python 3). You can use R as well; I'd say if you want to use a notebook and want to use R, use an Rnotebook in Rstudio; the effects will be same for the workflow that I outline here. The reason I'd go the python way with an ipynb notebook is that when you share the work and codes, most jupyter notebook servers (such as colaboratory or mybinder.org) use Python 2 or Python 3. So if your reader wants to verify your code and output, you provide him or her the opportunity to do that right away. Else, use something like an r-brain.io to work with julia or R codes to play with. I'd rather use an Rstudio code set for R codes.</div><div>Step 4: Use git to push the ipynb into the Authorea repo; ditto for Rnotebook markdown to push tables, figures, and text generated in the Rnotebook.</div><div></div><div>For this system to work, keep in mind these general principles:</div><div></div><div><b>Write in markdown; for tables use csv files, and for figures use jpg files</b></div><div><b>In Authorea, store the csv files in subfolders in the figures folder&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>In Authorea, store the jpeg files in subfolders in the figures folder</b></div><div><b>Use the layout.md file to position the various components. </b></div><div><b>Learn the config.yml file for figures; there is magic in the  config.yml file worth mastering</b></div><div><b>Use bibtex for citation management</b></div><div></div><div>For everything else, finish in Authorea itself. The html interface in Authorea is as intuitive as it gets, and for plain tables that are not csv, use a separate markdown chunk. The beauty of this system in Authorea is its flexibility (this is as of 2018) where it allows you to blend markdown, html, latex seamlessly. As a result, it does not matter what format you use to write your text. So, here are the step by step approach as to what goes where.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="410256" class="ltx_title_subsection">Step 1: Start with authorea</h2><div></div><div>So we want to build a dynamically updated publication system. By that I mean we are a team of diverse people (at the least two peo</div><div></div><div>paper as new information comes in and new analyses are conducted. We would need some dynamically updated parts and some consistent parts in such a document. We also need to collaborate and share the document, keep everything open so that the source code of the analyses remain in public domain. In any scholarly or information sharing publication, you need four elements:</div><div></div><ul><li>You need to produce tables of information</li><li>You need to provide your readers visualisation of elements</li><li>You need to attribute your arguments or statements with sources (citations)</li><li>For reproducible research you need to provide source codes of your analyses (here we have used python but you can use R or Julia as well). </li></ul><div>Mixing Authorea with dynamically developed graphs and tables is a great way to work. You can do all of these in the Authorea main interface by uploading from your local hard drive but you may also want to work on the web on the fly and here github is your friend. You will next need to do a couple of things:</div><div></div><h2 data-label="949138" class="ltx_title_subsection">Tables, figures, bibliography and layout</h2><div></div><div>For each of your figure and table you will need to create two files: a config.yml file and a caption.html file. The caption file will contain caption and the config.yml file will be different for figures and tables. The table with csv data will contain the ipynb file and the figure will contain the config.yml file and the caption.html file. The caption.html file will only contain the title for the figure or the table. The config.yml file is more involved and will contain the following set of codes:</div><div></div><div></div>
