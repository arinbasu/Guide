You will next need to do a couple of things:</div><div></div><h2 data-label="949138" class="ltx_title_subsection">Tables, figures, bibliography and layout</h2><div></div><div>For each of your figure and table you will need to create two files: a config.yml file and a caption.html file. The caption file will contain caption and the config.yml file will be different for figures and tables. The table with csv data will contain the ipynb file and the figure will contain the config.yml file and the caption.html file. The caption.html file will only contain the title for the figure or the table. The config.yml file is more involved and will contain the following set of codes:</div><div></div><div></div>
