<div>As the above diagram suggests there is a bimodal distribution in the age-standardised death rates from all causes in the world in 2012. We can examine other causes of death and test them against each other. </div><div></div><h2 data-label="745306" class="ltx_title_subsection">Case for a dynamic updating of this document with new insights and new diagrams as they become available</h2><div></div><div>The power of this system is apparent as we dynamically change the diagrams &amp; the analyses in different sections of the paper, and layout the different parts of the document on the fly not directly visiting the Authorea page but using the github and the other tools such as the jupyter notebook that we can connect to the github and sharing our analyses. More on these variations shortly. At any point, we can work with the jupyter notebooks to change the analyses and change the diagrams and the figures will dynamically change as well without any further uploading and work on our part. As we continue to refine the analyses and push the changes through github, the paper will continue to evolve. The markdown with its own set of citations also get cooped and dynamically updated as we continue to work. It take a one time set up to configure the yaml files but beyond that the paper gets updated dynamically. This helps in building an open yet collaborative paper or piece of work. If we want to then share the work widely, we can either use the jupyter notebook as a gist and share it, with a note here, or we share the notebook directly here. </div><div></div><div>As long as I settle on a set of diagrams and tables and continue to dynamically revise and update the document, the document will grow itself.
